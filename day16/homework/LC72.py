"""
Approach:
Dynamic Programming (2D Grid).
We use DP to track the minimum edit distance. Base cases (empty strings) are initialized at the edges.
If characters match, no operation is needed (take diagonal).
If they differ, we take 1 + minimum of insert (right), delete (bottom), or replace (diagonal).
